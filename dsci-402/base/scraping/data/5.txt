	Texting or talking on a cellphone while riding a bicycle would become illegal under a new bill that will be introduced in the City Council this week.


	Councilman Mark Treyger (D-Brooklyn) will sponsor the legislation, which would apply the same rules to cyclists that already apply to drivers.


	It would ban any use of a cellphone, tablet or computer except when attached to a hands-free device. Its currently legal to fiddle with a smart phone while riding a bike.


	It protects the life of the cyclist, and it protects the lives of those around them, Treyger said.


	If youre riding a bicycle and texting, youre obviously not paying attention to where youre going, and you could injure yourself or someone else, he said. If its reckless for drivers to do it - which it is - its just as irresponsible for cyclists.


	Tickets for texting or talking on the phone while biking will carry a $50 fine, which could rise to $200 for repeat violations.


	But first-time offenders who dont hurt anyone or cause property damage could avoid the fine by taking a bike safety class, which the city Department of Transportation and NYPD would be required to start offering next year.


	Treyger said he proposed the classes to make it clear the ban wasnt a money-raising gambit.


	We think we should be emphasizing education rather than collecting revenue, he said.


	Chicago has already banned texting and biking, as has Flagstaff, Ariz.


	Treyger said he was prompted to introduce the ban when he saw a cyclist on Stillwell Ave. in Brooklyn texting and veering in and out of traffic, nearly causing an accident.


	I was shocked to learn that there is no law prohibiting such a dangerous practice, he said.
