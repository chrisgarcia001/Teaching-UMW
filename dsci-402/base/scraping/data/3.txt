	Its the same concept as with a car. Someones whos biking needs to be alert, needs to think of safety first, he said. They cant do that if theyre simultaneously looking at a device.




	De Blasio said hed have to read the legislation before taking a position on the specific bill.


	I think the intent of the legislation is very good, but I have to see the specific language, he told reporters after marching in the Veterans Day parade.


	Under Treygers bill, texting and biking would carry a $50 fine, but first time offenders could get out of it by taking a bike safety class.
