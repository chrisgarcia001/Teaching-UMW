	We are deeply disappointed with the lack of real affordable housing and quality jobs in the Astoria Cove project. We know that we are not alone in our concerns. The Astoria Cove plan approved by the City Planning Commission has not received almost any public support, the dozen clergy members, part of the group Faith in New York, wrote in a letter to Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen and City Planning chair Carl Weisbrod.


	The City Planning Commission signed off on the 1700-apartment project, where developers led by Alma Realty have said 20% of the units will be affordable. It has to pass the City Council, where many pols have said they wont sign off without changes.


	At a minimum, the affordable housing in Astoria Cove needs to be affordable to the majority of residents who currently live in Astoria. Almas proposal intends to count units as expensive as $2700 for a one bedroom as affordable, the ministers wrote. The idea of affordable housing for families that make more than double the average income of current Astoria residents just doesnt make sense.


	The letter went on, We pray that this project will be able to provide the type of housing and jobs that our communities so desperately need. Unfortunately, we are far from that with this current deal.
