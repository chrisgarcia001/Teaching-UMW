	[City corporation counsel] Zach Carter, former U.S. Attorney, former prosecutor, I think one of the most respected people in law enforcement in this whole city, handled that. And my charge to him was to do what he thought was best, and what he thought was right for the city, de Blasio told reporters Tuesday. And he came to that settlement.


	De Blasio had campaigned on a promise to settle the case brought by the five men wrongfully convicted of rape, which he called a moral obligation, resulting in one of the largest settlements in city history.


	This was an extraordinary case, obviously, he said Tuesday.




	I never heard any such objection, he said. It's the first I'm ever hearing of any such disagreements. But ultimately the corp counsel is the person who decides. And we have a very highly respected corp counsel, and he decided what was the right amount."


	A spokesman could not immediately clarify whether de Blasio was informed or signed off on the $41 million figure before Carter finalized the deal.
