# Teaching @UMW
This repo contains code illustrations used in several courses I teach at the University of Mary Washington:

- DSCI 401 (Applied Machine Learning)
- DSCI 402 (Analytics Application Development)

Select semesters are kept here as the courses evolve, and this repository is often updated.
